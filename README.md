The OZ Governor Module belongs to the [Zodiac](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac) collection of tools, which can be accessed through the Zodiac App available on [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/), as well as in this repository.

### About the OZ Governor Module

The OZ Governor Module is an opinionated implementation of [OpenZeppelin's Governor](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/governance) contracts designed to be used in a Zodiac-style setup, allowing a Avatar (like a Gnosis Safe) to controlled by on-chain governance similar to [Compound's Governor Alpha and Bravo](https://compound.finance/docs/governance).

This module makes no changes to the existing Governor interface, in order to maintain compatibility with existing applications that support Governor. However, it does modify the behaviour of some existing functions, along with adding some additional functions, to enable it to be more easily used with an avatar.

Specifically, the following changes are important to note:
1. `_exdcutor()` returns the address stored at `owner`. So all `onlyGovernance()` checks are now equivalent to `onlyOwner()` checks.
2. `owner` can be set with `transferOwnership()`. This is important for enabling complex governance setups where the avatar may differ from the account that owns the governor module.
4. `execute` encodes the provided array of transactions as a delegate call to the [multisend contract](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/blob/main/contracts/libraries/MultiSend.sol) and triggers a call to `execTransactionFromModule()` on the address stored at `target`. This enables governor to be chained with other modifiers, like the [Delay](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-modifier-delay/) or [Roles](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-modifier-roles/) modifiers.

**Warning:** Tokens or value MUST NEVER be sent to the address of a deployed instance of this module, as they will be immediately lost. Rather, all value should be stored in the attached avatar (Gnosis Safe).

## Commands

To see available commands run `yarn hardhat`.

Some helpful commands:

```
yarn install # install dependencies
yarn build # compiles contracts
yarn coverage # runs the tests and displays contract coverage report
yarn deploy # deploys the contracts add the `--network` param to select a network
```

## Deployment

This project is set up to support both a "normal deployment" where the module is deployed directly, along with deployment via the Mastercopy / Minimal Proxy pattern (using our ModuleProxyFactory).

Currently, it is set up to deploy via the Mastercopy / Minimal Proxy pattern on Goerli and as a "normal deployment" on other networks. You can easily modify this behavior for your own module.

```
yarn deploy # "normal deployment"
yarn  deploy --network goerli # deploys a mastercopy and a minimal proxy for the module
```

The "normal deployment" can be useful for easily deploying and testing your module locally (for instance, the Hardhat Network).

The "normal deployment" deploys the MyModule contract and the test contracts (`contracts/test/Button.sol` and `contracts/test/TestAvatar.sol`), then sets the TestAvatar as the Button owner, and enables MyModule on the TestAvatar.

The Mastercopy / Minimal Proxy deployment deploys the MyModule mastercopy, a MyModule proxy, and the test contracts (contracts/test/Button.sol and contracts/test/TestAvatar.sol), then sets the TestAvatar as the Button owner and enables the MyModule proxy on the TestAvatar.

### Mastercopy and minimal proxys

When deploying modules that are going to be used for multiple avatars, it can make sense to use our Mastercopy/Proxy pattern. This deployment uses the Singleton Factory contract (EIP-2470). See a list of supported networks [here](https://blockscan.com/address/0xce0042B868300000d44A59004Da54A005ffdcf9f). For adding support to other chains, check out the documentation [here](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac/tree/master/src/factory#deployments) and [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2470).

## Attache your module to a Gnosis Safe

Once you have created a module and want to add it to a Gnosis Safe:

1. In the Gnosis Safe app, navigate to the "apps" tab and select the Zodiac Safe App.
2. Select "custom module", enter the address of your newly deployed module, and hit "Add Module".

It will then show up under Modules and Modifiers in the Gnosis Safe's Zodiac app.
